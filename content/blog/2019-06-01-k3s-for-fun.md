The industry is moving towards containers and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (K8s) won the rat race to become the standard platform. However, K8s is a daunting platform to run. Many projects try to make it easier in the cloud like Rancher and Amazon's EKS. Running it locally is even harder, but [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) made it possible with virtual machines. Now we have a new player coming out of Rancher Labs called [K3s](https://k3s.io/).

_"Easy to install. A binary of less than 40 MB. Only 512 MB of RAM required to run."_

Perfect for Raspberry Pis and local development purposes.

How does it take a big complex platform like Kubernetes and bundle it down to a 40MB binary on 512MB of RAM?

 - Removes Legacy, alpha, non-default features.
 - Removes in-tree plugins (cloud providers and storage plugins) that can be added in
 - Replaces etcd3 with Sqlite3
 - Adds TLS management
 - Comes Wrapped in a simple launcher

Excited yet? Let's get started.

Since it's written in [Go](https://golang.org/), it's all contained in a single binary. You can download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/rancher/k3s/releases/latest) or use your [package manager](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/k3s-bin/).

```bash
$ k3s server
```

If you run into errors with containerd, try using docker (not recommended):
```bash
$ k3s server --docker
```

You should be able to get some basic information now
```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml

$ kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at https://localhost:6443
CoreDNS is running at https://localhost:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

```

That's it. You are now running Kubernetes on your machine.

Let's start playing with it.

### Helm Basics

Helm is the standard for deploying applications on K8s. Think of it as the package manager for Kubernetes.

Helm packages are called **"charts"** and deployments are called **"releases"**.

They can define much more than just simple putting your application on K8s. Helm defines your deployment as code by specifying things like **replication count**, **anti-affinity**, **lifecycle hooks**, and **dependent charts**. Templates can be customized for different environments like production, pilot, and local development. Which makes it more powerful than running something like `kubectl run myapp --image=localhost:5000/myapp`.


```bash
# Installs tiller on K8s, should already be installed though
$ helm init

# Updates Repo
$ helm repo update
```

There's some useful charts you can install to help with local development:
```bash
$ helm install stable/redis
$ helm install stable/postgresql
$ helm install stable/nats
```

You can run some home automation applications on K3s using Helm. Which makes running a [little raspberry pi K3s cluster](https://blog.alexellis.io/test-drive-k3s-on-raspberry-pi/) a cool weekend project.

Use `helm search` and [Helm Hub](https://hub.helm.sh/) to find more!

K3s brings Kubernetes to people who may not be able get their hands on powerful servers or can pay for the cloud. They can run their desktop off a raspberry pi and K3s on another.

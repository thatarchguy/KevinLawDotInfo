Ten different schools were allowed to attend after  the qualifying round. The competition consists of four different teams:  The Blue team are the schools competing, The Red team are the  attackers, The White team is the support/scoring, and The Black team  takes care of the hardware and designed the network. The White team will  enter the room with “injects” for a team to complete. These injects are  various tasks that a real sysadmin may have to do in a real  environment. Here is an official description taken from the National  CCDC website:</span>

You know very little about the network, what  security level has been maintained, or what software has been installed.  You have a limited time frame to familiarize yourself with the network  and systems and to begin the security updates and patches before the red  team starts actively attacking your company. In the midst of all the  commotion, you have to keep up with the needs of the business and user  demands while maintaining service level agreements for all critical  Internet services. Welcome to the first day of the National Collegiate  Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC).</span>

Not only do students get a chance  to test their knowledge in an operational environment, they will also  get a chance to network with industry professionals who are always on  the lookout for up and coming engineers. &nbsp;CCDC provides a unique  opportunity for students and industry professionals to interact and  discuss many of the security and operational challenges the students  will soon face as they enter the job market.” (</span><a href="http://nationalccdc.org/"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #1155cc; font-family: Ubuntu; font-size: 11px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">http://nationalccdc.org</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Ubuntu; font-size: 11px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">)</span>

It was my first time attending  this event and I was the youngest on the team of eight. We prepared  months ahead of time for this event and even staged practice competitions in our lab. We each debated on different  strategies upon entering the room. We decided on each of us focusing on a  service, and learning as much as we could about it. Http, Https, Ftp,  Dns, Pop3, Smtp, AD, and Infrastructure. We printed out configs and  cheat sheets &nbsp;and put them into binders to walk in with. </span><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Ubuntu; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The  rules specifically state that you are not allowed to bring in anything  electronic or host code on a website for quick download. Only printed  materials were allowed. You cannot unplug your machine or the router  from the network. I  was given the clients to work on, which meant desktop operating systems  such as Windows xp/7/8 and Ubuntu desktop. I spent most of my time  learning how to lock each down with firewalls and only granting access  when needed. </span>

We walked in and machines were already  broken into. Passwords that were given to us were not working and odd  processes were running. We threw up our firewalls, changed passwords,  and started damage assessment. Scripts were found on the web server to  join it to an IRC botnet. There was also a cron job set to email  /etc/shadow and other info to the attacker. The windows boxes had some  vulnerable programs installed, including an old version of both IE and  OpenOffice. After clearing through the damage as best as we could, it  was time to start hardening our services and system. I focused on  uninstalling anything that was unnecessary and configuring the firewalls  on the machines. My teammates spent their time doing the same and  rewriting the configurations on their services. The injects started to  come in, and they kept coming. Setup a secure wireless with guest ssid,  configure openvpn, install and maintain Nagios, configure a physical  firewall, etc...</span>

That  night we wrote and printed more configs to prepare for the next day.</span>
    <br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Ubuntu; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">Saturday  was a ten hour non-stop day in the competition. It seemed to just be a  day of chaos and injects. The room was never quiet. One of the injects  was for the white team member in the room to simulate a typical user and  browse the internet. He was guided to a malicious website ran by the  red team, and prompted to install java and a bunch of applets. This took  out the windows 8 client and a windows xp client. It was difficult to  assess the damage that this did, so these computers were vlan’ed off the  network while I removed most of the infection.</span>

It was a hacking challenge for us to  capture a flag placed on a box running a webserver. The flag could be  anywhere on the system. We were only given an hour to complete the task,  and we could use whatever tools we could get our hands on. Our team  actually ended up winning the challenge! We were rewarded with a Pwn  Plug Elite by Pwnie Express (</span><a href="http://pwnieexpress.com/products/pwnplug-elite"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #1155cc; font-family: Ubuntu; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: underline; vertical-align: baseline;">http://pwnieexpress.com/products/pwnplug-elite</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Ubuntu; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">).  The Red Team told us that we captured the flag in under a minute from  the start of the connection to viewing the flag.txt file.</span>
<br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Ubuntu; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">The steps we took to completing the challenge:</span>
<br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Ubuntu; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Found a spot on the website to upload files. Attempted to upload php shells with no avail. </span>
<br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Ubuntu; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Moved on and check out robots.txt for clues. Found a bunch of directories in the listings.</span>
<br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Ubuntu; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Viewed the source of each, eventually finding a commented line describing a place to inject code,&nbsp;but&nbsp; was “disabled”.</span>
<br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Ubuntu; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Injected code and it worked, found the flag in the directory using linux commands.</span>

It was crazy to see how much they did and how they did it. I hope to go back next year and patch up some of the mistakes made this year. Plus I love to see what tricks the Red Team uses against us. I managed to print a few scripts out before I left.</span>

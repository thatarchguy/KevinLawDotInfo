I bought a Fujikam from Amazon. $100. It was laggy, noisy, and very difficult to download video logs. No email alerts. Push alerts to the app only worked when the app was open.   
I could go on about the features, but I think the security about the thing was worse...

All communications were clear text to some server in China owned by "Shenzhen Mining". *Awesome*.  
Not only that, but the thing was full of hardcoded backdoors. Meaning default admin passwords that cannot be changed.   
And this thing was internet accessible! It's currently the *best selling* IP camera on Amazon.

The alternatives? Pay a monthly fee for a service like Nest (dropcam) or dlink?  
Do you even trust a closed-source constantly running camera sending information *to the "cloud"*?  
I didn't think so.

Most mainstream DIY surveillance software sucks. They are usually paid software for servers running windows and IP cameras.  

[MotionEye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye) is a python program that can use webcams and a computer to become a security camera with full recording and alerts.  

[There is even a version for Raspberry Pi!](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos)

It's simple to install...

 - Get a [raspberry pi](http://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Model-Project-Board/dp/B00T2U7R7I/), attach a usb webcam or [camera module](http://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-5MP-Camera-Board-Module/dp/B00E1GGE40/). (or get an [all in one kit](http://www.amazon.com/Module--Edimax-Adapter--20-Guide--Clear-Supply--Kingston-Adapter--HDMI/dp/B010MMPZCS/))
 - [Download and extract motioneyeos](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/releases)
 - [Install motioneyeos image!](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md)
 - Log into the web interface from a laptop
 - Configure camera recording settings

I have mine saving recordings to my nas. I definitely recommend saving recordings to somewhere other than the pi.  

A cool feature is that you can cluster these together to get full coverage.
